          <h2 class="subtitle">December 2025 – Monthly Progress Statement</h2>
          <p>
            
During December 2025, solid progress was made regarding key decisions about the complexity and scope of our first AI model prototype. Following the selection of the initial model structure and the depth of the first dataset, we developed a custom telemetry logger designed to gather the selected system data across different computing environments.
<br><br>
The prototype, nicknamed Kale, learns from telemetry collected on systems using hardware components released after 2016. The objective is to obtain data across specific hardware families and a wide range of system configurations. At this stage, the prototype focuses on consumer-grade components for improved accessibility and faster validation.
This version of Kale is a validation-level prototype and currently evaluates GPU, CPU, and RAM telemetry. Its primary goal is to demonstrate predictive capability while verifying that the current data pipeline and model structure operate reliably and without structural issues.
<br><br>
A temporary RAM supply shortage has slightly limited our ability to gather a broader range of memory configurations across systems. This has resulted in a minor delay in expanding the dataset and will be addressed during January 2026 as availability improves.
<br><br>
On the events side, Hyquant’s founder, Morgan Foley, was selected to pitch at Next AI’s Open House in Montreal, marking Hyquant Research’s first public presentation with a founder present. While our primary focus remains technical development, we have launched this Updates section to provide transparency on Hyquant’s progress.
