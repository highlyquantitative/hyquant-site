          <h1>Our mission</h1>
          <h2 > Energy Management. </h2>
          <p>Our goal is to build an environmentally friendly future for the computing industry. 
            Around the world, data centers, AI workloads, and high-performance computing still rely 
            heavily on electricity produced from fossil fuels. At the same time, the short lifecycle 
            of overstressed hardware contributes to growing electronic waste.
            <br><br>
            Hyquant Research optimizes compute operations to reduce energy consumption, prevent premature
            hardware failure, and extend component lifespan. It begins with consulting during node and 
            server design, and continues through real-time telemetry monitoring and intelligent task 
            rerouting powered by our predictive-control AI.

        <section class="content-body">
          <h2 > Ethical AI.</h2>
          <p>By collecting hardware telemetry, task information, energy expenditure, and other compute-
            related variables, we build our own proprietary data pool. This dataset is generated entirely 
            by Hyquant Research and our partners through our custom logging tool. The logging process 
            analyzes hardware behavior and system processes without accessing any user data, ensuring a 
            fully secure and ethical workflow in which all parties are informed.

          <h2 > Certification for Responsible computing</h2>
          <p>Hyquant Research is developing a Green Compute certification, HYQGreen, for servers 
            optimized through our consulting and predictive-control model.
<br><br>
            This certification establishes trust between compute providers and end-users, especially 
            as AI adoption grows and questions arise about where the consumed energy originates. The 
            HYQ Green grade is awarded to the operator of the nodes and reflects the overall efficiency 
            and sustainability of their infrastructure. The certification signals that the company's 
            servers are optimized to minimize energy waste, reduce environmental impact, and follow 
            best practices in responsible computing.
