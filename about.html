          <p>Hyquant stands for “Highly Quantitative.” It was originally a small hardware-behavior 
            logging tool created by our founder to better understand and measure how computer components 
            behave under real workloads. The project began in October 2025 and has progressed rapidly 
            since then, driven by a full-time founder and the support of several advisors.
 <br><br>
           From the beginning, the company’s goals have been clear: reduce energy usage in compute-heavy tasks,
           ensure future machines are built using components that offer the best performance per watt, and
           establish a new standard for server management in the context of today’s environmental crisis.

         <h2 class="subtitle">The founder.</h2>
          <p>Hi, I’m Morgan Foley, the 19-year-old sole founder of Hyquant. I am a CEGEP student in Humanities 
            on the economic path, and I currently manage both the business and technical sides of the company. 
            My background has allowed me to lead this project and maintain fast, consistent progress.
 <br><br>
           I built my first computer at age 14 and continued refining this skill as I grew, helping many 
           people choose the right hardware for their needs. By age 16, I was running my own cryptocurrency 
           mining rigs and deepening my understanding of hardware performance and energy management.
 <br><br>
           At 18, I was scheduled to enter the Canadian Armed Forces as an Armoured Soldier, but due to 
           injury, I returned home with unexpected time to refocus. I went back to studying and pursued an 
           interest in finance and trading, which gave me the opportunity to visit Switzerland, France, and Monaco,
           where I built connections and learned from experienced business owners.
 <br><br>
          Despite my age, the combination of technical knowledge, real-world experience, and early exposure to 
          international business environments gives me a unique foundation to lead Hyquant. I am currently ahead 
          of our scaling plan deadlines and work on the venture full time.
